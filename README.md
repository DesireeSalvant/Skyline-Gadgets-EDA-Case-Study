# Skyline Gadgets: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

---

## Executive Summary

Skyline Gadgets is an online retailer specializing in a diverse range of electronics and accessories, including phones, computers, home electronics, and related categories. As the company scales its operations and transitions from spreadsheet-based tracking to data-driven decision making, this exploratory data analysis (EDA) project provides a foundational understanding of product performance, category-level trends, and revenue-driving behavior.

The goal of this analysis is to uncover actionable insights into what sells best, when it sells, and how much revenue is being generated across different segments. Using a cleaned sales dataset and Python-based tools (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib), the analysis explores both summary statistics and time-based trends to assist the business in smarter stocking, targeted promotions, and more effective resource allocation.

- Create a revenue metric to evaluate performance at both product and category levels  
- Identify top-performing products and categories by total revenue  
- Analyze monthly revenue trends to detect seasonal or cyclical sales patterns  
- Visualize key findings using clear, interpretable charts  
- Provide concrete business recommendations and highlight data quality concerns

# Assumptions

- All sales data is from a single monthly cohort ("May Cohort") unless otherwise stated.
- Missing or malformed date values have been temporarily labeled as `"Unknown"`; a future cleanup is recommended.
- Prices and quantities are assumed accurate post-cleaning; no major anomalies were found post-validation.
- Product and category names were standardized manually during the cleaning process (e.g., typos and casing).
- The number of units sold per order is unusually high (â‰ˆ27 items per order), which could be due to:
  - Bulk purchases
  - Bundled orders
  - Data entry anomalies (not confirmed without order-level metadata)
- Revenue was calculated using the formula: `Revenue = Price Ã— Quantity`
- Sales volume is assumed to represent **completed transactions**, not returns or pending orders.

---

## What's Next

- **Data Quality Improvements**  
  - Fix or backfill `"Unknown"` month values using raw timestamps or inferred logic  
  - Implement validation rules in data entry systems to reduce formatting issues

- **Product & Category Enrichment**  
  - Add product metadata such as brand, margin, or return rates  
  - Enable drill-down analysis on category subtypes or seasonal SKUs

- **Dashboard Enhancements**  
  - Add filters for region, order channel, or campaign code (if available)  
  - Deploy dashboard to authenticated internal environment or public cloud  
  - Include export options for stakeholders (e.g., PDF, CSV download)

- **Predictive Insights**  
  - Build a seasonality model to forecast monthly revenue  
  - Use machine learning to identify drivers of high-performing products

- **Automation & Reporting**  
  - Automate daily or weekly data refreshes into the dashboard  
  - Set up email alerts or Slack integrations for KPIs

- **A/B Testing & Marketing Analysis**  
  - Test promotional strategies like bundling, pricing changes, or ad timing  
  - Link sales data to web analytics for a complete funnel view
