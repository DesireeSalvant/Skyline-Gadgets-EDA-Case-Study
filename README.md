# Skyline Gadgets: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

---

## Executive Summary

Skyline Gadgets is an online retailer specializing in a diverse range of electronics and accessories, including phones, computers, home electronics, and related categories. As the company scales its operations and transitions from spreadsheet-based tracking to data-driven decision making, this exploratory data analysis (EDA) project provides a foundational understanding of product performance, category-level trends, and revenue-driving behavior.

The goal of this analysis is to uncover actionable insights into what sells best, when it sells, and how much revenue is being generated across different segments. Using a cleaned sales dataset and Python-based tools (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib), the analysis explores both summary statistics and time-based trends to assist the business in smarter stocking, targeted promotions, and more effective resource allocation.
